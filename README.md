The report describes the HeartPath Medical requirements for collecting data as well as storage solutions and analytical processing needs. HeartPath Medical needs systems with strong capabilities to deal with diverse real-time clinical and monitoring data streams. Scalable and secure storage techniques represent must-haves for healthcare organisations to fulfill encryption requirements and achieve operational compliance with data protection regulations. The implementation of complex analytics, especially machine learning becomes essential because these systems produce predictive information about patient treatment and device operation. The infrastructure requirements for cloud deployment demand fast processing of data alongside real-time system monitoring and flexible data source integration. Meeting GDPR requirements together with local data residency standards stands as an essential necessity. The infrastructure establishes HeartPath’s foundation to accelerate research partnerships and positions the organisation as a leader in cardiac monitoring healthcare services.
